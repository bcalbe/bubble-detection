    \section{Comparison of bubble detectors and size distribution estimators}    
        Bubble(circular objects) dtection algorithms can be divided into two approaches, geometry-based and appearance-based.

        Geometry-based approaches detects parameterized circular objects in the image edge map.

        Drawbacks: Sensitive to noise, high false positive rate. 

        Appearance-based appraches using sliding window combining with a classier like boosting based, 
        Hog based and CNN classifier

        Drawbacks: need large amount of training data.
